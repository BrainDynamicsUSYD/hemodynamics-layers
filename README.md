# hemodynamics-layers
MATLAB codes for simulating spatiotemporal hemodynamic responses across the cortical depth. The simulated hemodynamics responses are optimized to correspond to BOLD-fMRI responses in the visual cortex.

# Usage
Add the repository to your MATLAB path and run Mainfunction.m. This will automatically create the stimulus, simulate the hemodynamic model, and plot the generated results. The parameters of the model (at hemodynamicConstants.m) can be changed to simulate say variability in responses or cortical region-specific responses. In addition, the input stimulus can varied in appliedDrive.m (currently set to a Gaussian).
